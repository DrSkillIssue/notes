## Step 5 - Add Local Files to Spotify
> This step will only have to be performed once.

**Note Output Directory**
* With *Viwazard Audible Converter* opened, take note of the **Output** directory as this is required for Spotify:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/93b77e3f-8c82-4593-a475-3188fd648e20)

* In my above example, *Viwizard* saves my converted books in _my Documents folder -> Viwizard Audible COnverter -> Converted_

**Enable Local Files in Spotify**

* Open Spotify if not done so already
* Open your Preferences via Top-Left by selecting **... -> Edit -> Preferences**:

* Under **Your Library** Enable **Show Local Files**:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/729fdbf7-5d87-4690-8a8f-6f40ce90ae2f)

**View Local Files**
> NOTE: It may take a minute or so for Spotify to realize you've enabled Local Files. You may need to restart Spotify.

* Eventually, you'll notice a new playlist within **Your Library** called **Local Files**:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fb83032c-852c-4f36-a8ee-11cc61c73761)

* Here is where you can view your newly converted books and add them to your **Books** playlist or whatever playlist you desire:
> NOTE: The book may not show up instantly within **Local Files** as it's not instant. To force resync your local files to Spotify, close and reopen.
